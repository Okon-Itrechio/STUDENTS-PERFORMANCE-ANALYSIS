# STUDENTS-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyse students' performance data to using factors such as race/ethnicity,  
parents' educational level, the quality of lunch received and test-preparation to gain insight into  
their performance.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data

## Methods
•	Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned and columns such as ID, Average score and Grade were added to the dataset.
•	Data Visualization: Visualization was done by using Power BI to create dashboards and highlight on key metrics such as total average by parental level of education, race /ethnicity, type of lunch and test preparation. Gender distribution was also highlighted. 
## Tools
1.	Microsoft Excel
2.	SQL Server
3.	Power BI

## Insights and Findings
•	The dataset contained 1000 students with 482 male and 518 female students.

•	The class average score is approximately 67.77. Male students averaged 65.84, while female students averaged 69.57.

•	Students who had standard lunch performed better than while those who had free/reduced lunch.

•	Students who completed test preparation course performed better those who didn't complete test preparation course.

•	 Students with parents that had higher level of education performed better that those with parents with lower level of education. 

      o	Master's Degree: 74
  
      o	Bachelor's Degree: 72
  
      o	Associate Degree: 70
  
      o	Some College Degree: 68
  
      o	Some High School: 65
  
•	Students belonging to Race/Ethnic Group E and Group D had the highest performance. Students in race/ethnic Group A was the ethnic group with the lowest performance.

## Recommendations
•	Students must ensure they complete test preparation course as this will enhance their performance. 

•	Students to encourage their parents to upgrade their level of education as this will greatly influence their academic performance

•	Students should encourage to eat standard lunch as quality of food affects their performance.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that female students performed better than male students. However, male students performed better in Math while female students performed better in Reading and Writing. Students who had standard lunch in school performed better compared to those who had free/reduced lunch. Students who completed a test preparation course performed better than those who didn't had test preparation course. Finally, student parents with higher level of education greatly influenced their performance.
