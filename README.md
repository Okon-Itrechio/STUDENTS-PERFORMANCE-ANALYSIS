# STUDENTS-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyse students' performance data to gain insights into their performance 
in relation to factors such as race/ethnicity, parents' educational level, the quality of lunch 
received at school, and whether they completed any test-preparation courses before taking the actual tests.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data

## Methods
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned  and three more columns were included which are ID, Average score and Grade columns.
•	Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create dashboards and visual reports to highlight key metrics such as total average, gender distribution by race/ethnicity, total average by race/ethnicity and lunch type, and so on.

## Tools
1.	Microsoft Excel
2.	SQL Server
3.	Power BI

## Insights and Findings
•	Gender balance: The dataset contained 482 male and 518 female students.

•	Performance Insights: The class average score is approximately 67.77. Male students averaged 65.84, while female students averaged 69.57.

•	Lunch Type: Students who had standard lunches averaged 70.84, while those who had free/reduced lunch averaged 62.20

•	Test Preparedness Course: Those who completed a test preparedness course outperformed those who didn't (72.7 to 65.0 average scores).

•	Parents' Level of Education: Students' average performances were proportional to the level of their parents' educational level. 

      o	Master's Degree: 74
  
      o	Bachelor's Degree: 72
  
      o	Associate Degree: 70
  
      o	Some College Degree: 68
  
      o	Some High School: 65
  
      o	High School: 63
  
•	Race/Ethnicity: Group E (72.7 average score) and Group D (69.2 average score) were the highest performers. Group A, with an average of 63.0, was the ethnic group with the least performance.

## Recommendations
Students should be encouraged to complete a test-preparation course before they take the main test, as it guarantees better grades. The school can subsidies lunch for all students and serve everyone standard lunches; there is a direct relationship between the quality of food and students' performances.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that female students performed better than male students. However, male students performed better in Math (with an average score of 68.73), while female students performed better in Reading and Writing (with average scores of 72.61 and 72.47, respectively). Students who had standard lunch in school performed better (with an average score of 70.84) when compared to those who had free/reduced lunches, who averaged 62.20. Students who completed a test preparedness course outperformed those who didn't (72.7 to 65.0 average scores). Parents' level of education directly influenced students' performance.
